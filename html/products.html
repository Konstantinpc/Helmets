        <p class="products-p"><span>WHO is bringing the world’s scientists and global health professionals together</span> to accelerate the research and development process, and develop new norms and standards to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and help care for those affected.
          <br/><br/>The R&D Blueprint has been activated to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for this novel coronavirus.           
          <br/><br/>The solidarity of all countries will be essential to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 health products.
          <br/><br/><br/><span>Global research database</span>
          <br/><br/>WHO is gathering the latest international multilingual scientific findings and knowledge on COVID-19. The global literature cited in the WHO COVID-19 database is updated daily (Monday through Friday) from searches of bibliographic databases, hand searching, and the addition of other expert-referred scientific articles. This database represents a comprehensive multilingual source of current literature on the topic. While it may not be exhaustive, new research is added regularly.          
          <br/><br/>The WHO evidence retrieval sub-group has begun collaboration with key partners to enrich the citations and build a more comprehensive database with inclusion of other content. The database is built by BIREME, the Specialized Center of PAHO/AMRO and part of the Regional Office’s Department of Evidence and Intelligence for Action in Health. 
          <br/><br/>For further information or questions, please contact the WHO Library via email.     
          <br/><br/><span>Other resources on coronavirus disease (COVID-19)</span>

Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.
          <br/><br/>The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products in publications listed in the database does not imply that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by initial capital letters.

The database has been compiled without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied. The responsibility for the interpretation and use of publications included in this database lies with the reader. In no event shall WHO be liable for damages arising from its use.</span></p>
